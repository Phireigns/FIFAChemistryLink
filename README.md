<h1>FIFA Chemistry Builder</h1>

V1.1

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a quick chemistry builder for the discord bot "Soccer Guru", I was going through many hurdles trying to find chemistry for my team so this is to fix that! Feel free to use it! 

Download the whole file and open the NakoLink.exe. Write the player name, nation, league, and club of each of your players. 
After that hit calculate and it will tell you if your players are Green, Yellow, or Red, and at the end it will tell you if your team has perfect chemistry or not!

PLEASE NOTE you need to run it anyway, there is no VIRUS! I have also added the python code if others want to work further or to see that there is no virus in it.

You can also create the .exe shortcut to your Desktop or anywhere for easier access. PLEASE DO NOT MOVE nakolink.exe file from its folder location as it requires the JSON file and the icon file to load the players data and icon, although you can move the folder anywhere though.

See the info.png photo to see how it works.

Another player_data.json folder will be created to store your players data, so when you close and open the program next time, you won't have to input all the names and data again.
